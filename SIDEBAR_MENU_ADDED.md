## 🎯 **How to Test**

1. **Open your browser** and go to `http://localhost:8084/`

3. **Look at the sidebar** - you should now see:
   - "Bench Resources" menu item with dropdown

3. **Create Hotlist** - Form-based hotlist creation wizard
4. **Scheduled Hotlists** - Calendar view of scheduled campaigns
5. **Performance Analytics** - Detailed analytics dashboard
6. **Subject Templates** - Template management interface

## ✅ **Status: COMPLETE**

The sidebar menu integration is now complete and fully functional. Users can navigate to all the new features through the sidebar menu system, just like the existing HR Onboarding functionality!
