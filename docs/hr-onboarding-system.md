```

### 🔧 **Technology Stack**
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **UI Components**: Custom UI library with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Data Fetching**: Custom service layer with mock data
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Notifications**: Custom toast system
- **Forms**: Controlled components with validation

### 📡 **API Integration**
The system uses a service layer (`hrOnboardingService.ts`) that currently implements mock data but is designed to easily integrate with real APIs:

```typescript
// Example service method
async getCandidates(page: number, limit: number, filters?: CandidateFilters): Promise<OnboardingCandidatesResponse>
```

## Data Models

## User Interface

### 🎨 **Design Principles**
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliant with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Consistent UI**: Follows established design patterns from the main application
- **Performance**: Optimized loading states and efficient data handling

### 🔍 **Key UI Features**
- **Advanced Filtering**: Multi-criteria filtering with real-time updates
- **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple items for batch processing
