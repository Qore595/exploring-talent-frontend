# Bench Resource & Hotlist Management Features

## 🎉 New Features Added

This implementation adds comprehensive Bench Resource Management and Hotlist Management systems to your application with mock data for immediate testing.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Start the development server** (already running on http://localhost:8084/)
2. **Navigate to the new features**:
   - **Bench Resources**: Go to `/bench-resources` in your browser
   - **Hotlist Management**: Go to `/hotlists` in your browser

## 📋 Features Overview

### 🔧 Bench Resource Management (`/bench-resources`)
- **Resource Dashboard**: View all available bench resources with statistics
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by status, location, skills, and more
- **Status Pipeline**: Track resources through the recruitment pipeline
- **Work Authorization**: Role-based visibility of work authorization details
- **Mock Data**: 6 sample resources with different statuses and skills

### 📧 Hotlist Management (`/hotlists`)
- **Hotlist Dashboard**: View all hotlists with performance metrics
- **Campaign Creation**: Create targeted email campaigns
- **Performance Analytics**: Track open rates, responses, and conversions
- **Scheduling System**: Set up immediate or recurring campaigns
- **Mock Data**: 3 sample hotlists with different statuses and metrics

## 🎯 Key Components Created

### Frontend Components
- `BenchResourcesPage.tsx` - Main bench resources dashboard
- `HotlistsPage.tsx` - Main hotlist management dashboard
- `SubjectBuilder.tsx` - Dynamic email subject creation
- `SchedulingInterface.tsx` - Campaign scheduling system
- `CandidatePreviewCards.tsx` - Candidate selection interface
- `PerformanceAnalytics.tsx` - Analytics dashboard

### Backend API (Ready for Integration)
- `benchResourceController.js` - Complete CRUD operations
- `hotlistController.js` - Hotlist management
- `autoEnrollmentService.js` - Auto-enrollment logic
- Database models for all entities

### Permission System
- `useMockPermissions.ts` - Mock role-based access control
- `permissionsService.ts` - Full permission management system
- 7 user roles with granular permissions

## 🔐 Mock Permissions

Currently using mock permissions that grant full access. You can modify permissions in `src/hooks/useMockPermissions.ts`:

```typescript
const defaultPermissions: MockPermissions = {
  canViewWorkAuthorization: true,    // Set to false to hide work auth
  canManageBenchResources: true,     // Set to false for read-only
  canCreateBenchResource: true,      // Set to false to hide "Add" button
  canCreateHotlists: true,          // Set to false to hide "Create" button
  canViewAnalytics: true,           // Set to false to hide analytics
  canManageSettings: true,          // Set to false to hide settings
};
```

- **Creation Tools**: Subject builder, scheduling

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding More Mock Data
Edit the mock arrays in:
- `src/pages/bench-resources/BenchResourcesPage.tsx` (mockBenchResources)
- `src/pages/hotlists/HotlistsPage.tsx` (mockHotlists)

### Changing Permissions
Modify `src/hooks/useMockPermissions.ts` to test different permission scenarios.

### Styling
All components use your existing UI component library and follow the same design patterns.

## 🧪 Testing

### Unit Tests Created
- `src/services/__tests__/permissionsService.test.ts`
- `src/services/__tests__/benchResourceService.test.ts`
- `src/components/hotlists/__tests__/SubjectBuilder.test.tsx`
- `server/services/__tests__/autoEnrollmentService.test.js`

### Run Tests
```bash
npm test
```

## 📚 Documentation

Comprehensive guides available:
- `docs/BENCH_RESOURCES_GUIDE.md` - Complete user guide
- `docs/HOTLIST_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md` - Hotlist system documentation

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Test the Features**: Navigate to `/bench-resources` and `/hotlists`
2. **Customize Permissions**: Modify mock permissions to test different roles
3. **Add Real Data**: Replace mock data with API calls when backend is ready
4. **Extend Features**: Add more components like pipeline view, settings pages
5. **Integration**: Connect to your existing authentication and user management

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Page not loading**: Check if routes are properly added to App.tsx
- **Permission errors**: Verify MockPermissionsProvider is wrapping the components
- **Missing icons**: Ensure all Lucide React icons are imported
- **Styling issues**: Check if all UI components are properly imported

### Support
All components are built with TypeScript and include comprehensive error handling. Check the browser console for any runtime errors.
